# Airlines-Fare-Prediction
Project to predict the price of different airlines using data analysis, visualizations and modelling.

Here I have used two algorithms named Random forest and Linear Regression.
Random forest is suitable here. I have used Linear Regression just to show that not everywhere it is necessary to use Linear Regression.
